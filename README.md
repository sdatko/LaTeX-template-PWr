LaTeX template PWr
==================

LaTeX template I use in my work related to
Wrocław University of Science and Technology.


# Acknowledgments

This work is inspired by a LaTeX template created by Wojciech Myszka [1].
I took an opportunity to learn more about LaTeX and to prepare a solution
that is better suited to all my needs.

This template uses background images from the original file provided by
Wrocław University of Science and Technology [2]. However, the "HR Excellence
in Research" icon was taken from Myszka's template [1] due to a better
resolution compared to the one from original source [2].
